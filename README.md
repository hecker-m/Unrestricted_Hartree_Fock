# Unrestricted_Hartree_Fock
Contains a short Matlab routine that implements an unrestricted Hartree-Fock routine.

The project (described in the pdf notes) starts from a bosonic superconducting Hamiltonian.
After simplification to a Bogoliuboc-de-Gennes Hamiltonian, we analyze the fluctuation regime
with respect to potential preformed phases, 
either nematic, ferromagnetic, or charge-4e superconducting phases.

(Code has not been maintained or improved since 2021.)
